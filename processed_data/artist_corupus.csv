Eminem,i can't tell you what it really is i can only tell you what it feels like and right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe i can't breathe but i still fight while i can fight as long as the wrong feels right it's like i'm in flight high off her love drunk from her hate it's like i'm huffin' paint and i love her the more i suffer i suffocate and right before i'm about to drown she resuscitates me she fuckin' hates me and i love it wait where you going i'm leaving you no you ain't come back we're runnin' right back here we go again it's so insane 'cause when it's goin' good it's goin' great i'm superman with the wind at his back she's lois lane but when it's bad it's awful i feel so ashamed i snapped who's that dude i don't even know his name i laid hands on her i'll never stoop so low again i guess i don't know my own strengthyou ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em you meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em got that warm fuzzy feelin' yeah them chills used to get 'em now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em you swore you'd never hit 'em never do nothin' to hurt 'em now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em you push pull each other's hair scratch claw bit 'em throw 'em down pin 'em so lost in the moments when you're in 'em it's the rage that took over it controls you both so they say you're best to go your separate ways guess that they don't know ya 'cause today that was yesterday yesterday is over it's a different day sound like broken records playin' over but you promised her next time you'll show restraint you don't get another chance life is no nintendo game but you lied again now you get to watch her leave out the window guess that's why they call it window panenow i know we said things did things that we didn't mean then we fall back into the same patterns same routine but your temper's just as bad as mine is you're the same as me when it comes to love you're just as blinded baby please come back it wasn't you baby it was me maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano all i know is i love you too much to walk away though come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk don't you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball next time i'm pissed i'll aim my fist at the drywall next time there won't be no next time i apologize even though i know it's lies i'm tired of the games i just want her back i know i'm a liar if she ever tries to fuckin' leave again i'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire just gonna just gonna stand there and watch me burn well that's all right because i like the way it hurts just gonna stand there and hear me cry well that's all right because i love the way you lie i love the way you lie i love the way you lie

if i don't utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on i'm back from the mathers lp when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put 'em all in a line add an ak a revolver and a see if i get away with it now

and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music oh he's too mainstream well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it it's not hip hop it's pop 'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on lose yourself and make 'em lose it i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongue in cheek fuck you i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake 'em a cake then don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and don't be a

Dave,like i met my girl when i was eighteen years old and she was just turnin' twenty three i really love her from my heart and even though i don't deserve it fam i hope she loves me so i just done this private show i'm doin' footlocker promo and judgin' from the postcode it was shoreditch or soho did six or seven tracks made six or seven racks a couple days later on twitter i saw this photo of myself and i was grinning that k camera of quality had got me tripping so i'm checking out who did it when i stumbled on this girl and i could tell that she was different a couple hours later now i'm liking all her pictures i ain't finished i typed her twitter name into my insta so i could check on every single little digit why didn't i just message her trust me i was thinking but i'm a self centred rapper too concerned about my image the truth so when she hit me first i'm pretty shocked i didn't burst i'm callin' josh jack and juss who am i ringin' first man i was so excited that i replied a minute later that's that bro i think that you just let her know excited too excited no clue on what i should do excited so i'm just typin' ramblin' like a fool excited see dave liveget tickets as low as you might also like look look and we were talkin' for hours over some minor things ignorin' everyone else to her i'm replyin' quick this type of chick she got a spark like you were lightin' spliffs you know you like her when you're thinking about your words she got me typing deleting my messages then re writing in the hope that there's a smile when she's replyin' the highlight of my day them phone calls in the night it's the little things the girl she had a vibe and i liked it and she's into photography she's got a passion for it and she respects that i'm rappin' but she ain't cattin' for it see that's the perfect balance there's nothin' better than a girl with talent drive ambition all of them things above she's showin' in abundance i ain't even met her yet she works around the corner but lives just outside of london i ain't frontin' i'm a sweet boy intentions are in question so my compliments are decoys if that even makes sense the first time i met her i'm surrounded by my friends random ends on some staircase so much for a first date i just had a show and i asked if she could meet me after maybe we could chill you never know where things could go no problem she down to roll travelled in the cold so i went across the road grey hoodie under her coat if i'm rememberin' correctly it's always kind of weird when a person that you were texting's a person that you're obsessed with i was on her from the jump i think she was wearin' pumps or vans when i first met her know it's either either one she was lookin' so attractive i barely saw skin 'cause she was covered like a mattress man i think that she's the one i was stuck for twenty seconds tryna to give the girl a hug and all my friends are drunk so fuck it i'm 'bout to kiss her any complications i'm blamin' it on the liquor changin' my name on twitter and blockin' her on my insta i saw her skin blush the moment that our lips touched she pulled my bottom lip until it stretched kissed me on my cheek until she reached around my neck and had me moanin' like a bitch even though i'm wearin' jeans i had to re arrange my dick so she don't see that i'm erect it's the first time we met got me feelin' like a creep and that strawberry flavour gave her tongue a kinda sweet little taste and we could speak about anything we were friends first i dropped her to the station i remember 'cause we had a conversation for ages about our dreams and the things that we hadn't seen and all that we intended to do i bet she's hopin' my intentions are true and as months went by we both got into it and intimate and i'ma spare you the details 'cause both of our parents are probably listenin' but really we were into it into us into this into everything about each other we were lovers and i love her 'cause she knows me and that's probably why she told me you ain't ready for a girl you're still a little kid that's gettin' ready for the world and you don't need that kinda burden but i told her that i want it and i'm just being honest yes i know that girls exist but i don't see them as a problem i meant every single word and i ain't gonna lie and say dm's have been absurd but out of every single girl this is the weirdest of positions it's usually the girl that's askin' where i see her fittin' or a place on her position but i'm tellin' her i need it and i don't think she sees it so i'm being even sweeter when we're speakin' and we're meetin' i've got affectionate messages you could read them you gotta tell a girl that she's beautiful till she sees it believes it understands it more than physically mentally and the way that i'm feelin' i could talk for ten years about the moments that we shared the jokes that we had runnin' the places that we been the music we made together producin' next to my bed then makin' my minor changes in reference to what she said i think i started gettin' tired my schedule's a mess replies are gettin' lazy and my lady knows it's crazy but she's there if i'm in need while i'm at shows gettin' tempted by girls that are on their knees you know i'm only a teen it's like my eyes started driftin' not as easy as i pictured to give your all to a woman ignorin' all this attention that's been gettin' to my head the sex is so accessible one message or text and girls will get in your bed she's tryna make it happen with photos at her events i mention it's her passion photography is her thing and i don't know if it's the pressure where paper meets the passion and the pleasure we all gotta work to survive so now she's popping up at shows takin' pictures on her own and at first it wasn't cool but fuck it we'll let it go until i saw her in some rapper's tracksuit i felt a way she told me it was work and she was in some studio takin' pictures and i just sighed some halfway wannabe rappers had fed her lies they ain't lookin' for no picture i know it's your profession but read their intentions they ain't payin' male photographers to shoot that same session and i felt so disrespectful standin' on her dreams and crushin' 'em i just told her it's nothing do what you need to do if i ain't feedin' you then my opinion's all i'm givin' when i speak to you 'cause i don't have the right why should girls be punished for a male's dirty mind when i think about it now i'm ashamed to the core i mean how many men stop their women from achievin' what they can because in secret they been feelin' insecure and i can't handle my emotions it's probably why i didn't see her talent when i should've been supportin' and promotin' like i didn't have a platform a voice and a followin' with everyone i knew i really coulda done a lot of things to help chase her dream but instead of me to grow into the person that she needs i acted like i couldn't see and i don't mean to say this like i don't trust the girl but how can i trust her if i don't trust myself and even girls can get tempted you know how it goes what if she meets a bigger rapper when she's at a show what if he sees her backstage what if he's sellin' lots what if he's got a bigger car got a better watch that doesn't bother me she really ain't material it's all the little things they do that put the fear in you what if he actually replies what if he phones her too what if he's doin' all the things that i'm supposed to do what if he's listenin' laughin' relatin' what if he even cares to ask her how her day's been what if he's tryna give her everything she needs and expects from the one damn person that she's datin' i shoulda helped her follow her dream but instead i held her back and had her followin' me and boy's got a brave face so they'll never know that it hurts just as much when you let them go

Dave, i spent my th birthday in the hospital with my brother and my mum and i know it sounds dumb but i felt like i lost it all the pain's compulsory suffering's optional takeshi's castle my life's got obstacles i'm still dealing with a whole load of stress i see my older brother so close to the edge and that there put a hole in my chest and then they tell you home's where the heart is but i got a hole where my heart is because i let a ho where my heart is never again i had to tell her that we're better as friends i never messaged again every message i send ends up in a groupchat 'cause girls go and tell all their friends that's one of many reasons why i ain't sending dms look i'm gonna keep this cake and i'm gonna eat this cake that's why i'm living three lives i'm in gta i'm in los angeles driving a mercedes and it's funny because honestly i didn't think i'd see la surprise birthday party i didn't see this cake coming i need this money like its ema you gotta separate the rats from the g's if you can't handle cheese how the hell you gonna be a great i need a blazing inferno for my enemies behind my back i know that everybody sends for me and i'd respond but i don't even have the time i mean asking avelino couldn't help me find the energy i don't think my ends want the best for me that's why they question me fake g checking me fuck the road but if anybody's testing me it's one step away like a a side penalty every santander nationwide remembers me right pocket full of cards i'm a referee ain't it funny how this money that i'm getting came from fucking pa's like i'm sleeping with a secretary secondly your girlfriend's obsessed with me but that's a story for another day and this is why love is fucked 'cause you went and put your trust in her and then sent me nudes i said nuh uh uh cover up i aired it certain girls i can't respect we're all nothing to someone and that you can't forget so just remember when the girl's playing hard to get there's probably another person that she's trying hard to get and there's probably a girl in your phone right now that you hardly text that's looking for love but everybody wants what they can't touch so see dave liveget tickets as low as you might also like if you touch my money you can see what i'm about you can ask your little sister i will be inside your house eating from your fridge feet up on your couch tell your little brother butter me a sandwich spread in evenly amounts you think i'm playing any games why do you think i talk about cars women and chains on half of the songs i make materialistic aims make me feel a way when i want it when i got it it don't ever feel the same we got different types of problems i'm getting corporate tax on this cash that i'm making and at the same time i need to vanquish my paigons if you think it's dead you're mistaken i'm hot headed and dangerous and still living in this matrix all i wanna do is make my loved ones proud in this year alone we made three hundred thousand but my mum won't smile because her son's on trial we've got different types of problems what do you know about living in a shadow where every single thing that you can do is being

cat a prison while i'm standing on an arrow we used to have cards and now we're playing with swords my g went from blackjack to a black jack sparrow i know so many man who got a case on their head that would kill to come home but their chances are narrow in this world that we live in nobody listens we do have thoughts but nobody's thinking and i get it 'cause none of us are tryna play the victim any disrespect then retaliation instant i know a lot of man have been dodging karma and they think it's all laughter 'til the bitch comes to kiss them you know the difference between life and death is one bad decision or inches so many man my age have got p t s d and i don't think that it's hit them if you envision the way that we're living the things that we had seen situations that we'd been in you would understand why i don't wanna talk about my life in every song i've ever written i really wanna help but it's out of my control and jurisdiction 'cause a lot of road yutes have got a sickness mentally like look my mummy always used to tell me this david listen when your older's speaking i know man that listened to their olders speaking and now they're all life'd off and they don't
