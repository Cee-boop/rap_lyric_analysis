Using lyrics to practice NLP and sentiment analysis, I decided to use 11 artists for this: Drake, Eminem, J, Cole, Rapsody, Kendrick Lamar, Nicki Minaj, 2Pac, Nas, Skepta, Dave, and
Future. To compile the data for this I used Sportify's top 50 playlist for each artist mentioned, plus Genius' API to grab lyrics for each track.
