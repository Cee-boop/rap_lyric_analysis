 [Outro]So looking at it from another perspective, playing devil's advocateConsidering you know you're obviously becoming famous, so to speakBut you still deal with a lot of issues on a human levelDo you ever just sit and wonder about the stories behind the people you meet day by day?Does it make you feel grateful, in a weird way, for your life and problems?

How I Met My Ex,Dave,Dave,445349,False,"[Verse 1]LikeI met my girl when I was eighteen-years-oldAnd she was just turnin' twenty-threeI really love her from my heartAnd even though I don't deserve it, fam, I hope she loves meSo I just done this private show, I'm doin' Footlocker promoAnd judgin' from the postcode it was Shoreditch or SohoDid six or seven tracks, made six or seven racksA couple days later on Twitter I saw this photo of myself and I was grinningThat 4K camera of quality had got me trippingSo I'm checking out who did itWhen I stumbled on this girlAnd I could tell that she was differentA couple hours later now I'm liking all her picturesI ain't finishedI typed her Twitter name into my Insta so I could check on every single little digitWhy didn't I just message her?Trust me I was thinking, but I'm a self-centred rapper too concerned about my imageThe truthSo when she hit me first I'm pretty shocked I didn't burstI'm callin' Josh, Jack and Juss, who am I ringin' first?Man, I was so excited that I repliedA minute later, that's that ""Bro, I think that you just let her know"" excitedToo excited, no clue on what I should do excitedSo I'm just typin', ramblin' like a fool, excited

 [Verse 2]Look, lookAnd we were talkin' for hours over some minor thingsIgnorin' everyone else, to her, I'm replyin' quickThis type of chick, she got a spark like you were lightin' spliffsYou know you like her when you're thinking about your wordsShe got me typing, deleting my messages then re-writingIn the hope that there's a smile when she's replyin'The highlight of my day, them phone calls in the night, it's the little thingsThe girl, she had a vibe and I liked it andShe's into photography, she's got a passion for itAnd she respects that I'm rappin' but she ain't cattin' for itSee, that's the perfect balance, there's nothin' better thanA girl with talent, drive, ambition, all of them things aboveShe's showin' in abundance, I ain't even met her yetShe works around the corner but lives just outside of LondonI ain't frontin', I'm a sweet boy, intentions are in questionSo my compliments are decoys if that even makes senseThe first time I met her, I'm surrounded by my friendsRandom ends on some staircase, so much for a first dateI just had a show and I asked if she could meet me afterMaybe we could chill, you never know where things could goNo problem, she down to roll, travelled in the coldSo I went across the road, grey hoodie under her coatIf I'm rememberin' correctly, it's always kind of weird whenA person that you were texting's a person that you're obsessed withI was on her from the jump, I think she was wearin' pumpsOr Vans when I first met her, know it's either either oneShe was lookin' so attractive, I barely saw skin'Cause she was covered like a mattress, man, I think that she's the oneI was stuck for twenty seconds tryna to give the girl a hugAnd all my friends are drunk so fuck it, I'm 'bout to kiss herAny complications, I'm blamin' it on the liquorChangin' my name on Twitter and blockin' her on my InstaI saw her skin blush the moment that our lips touchedShe pulled my bottom lip until it stretchedKissed me on my cheek until she reached around my neckAnd had me moanin' like a bitch, even though I'm wearin' jeansI had to re-arrange my dick so she don't see that I'm erectIt's the first time we met, got me feelin' like a creepAnd that strawberry flavour gave her tongue a kinda sweet little tasteAnd we could speak about anything we were friends firstI dropped her to the station, I remember'Cause we had a conversation for ages about our dreamsAnd the things that we hadn't seen and all that we intended to doI bet she's hopin' my intentions are trueAnd as months went by we both got into itAnd intimateAnd I'ma spare you the details 'cause both of our parents are probably listenin'But really we were into it, into us, into thisInto everything about each other, we were loversAnd I love her 'cause she knows me and that's probably why she told meYou ain't ready for a girl, you're still a little kid that'sGettin' ready for the world and you don't need that kinda burdenBut I told her that I want it and I'm just being honestYes, I know that girls exist but I don't see them as a problemI meant every single word and I ain't gonna lie and sayDM's have been absurd but out of every single girlThis is the weirdest of positions, it's usually the girlThat's askin' where I see her fittin' or a place on her positionBut I'm tellin' her I need it and I don't think she sees itSo I'm being even sweeter when we're speakin' and we're meetin'I've got affectionate messages, you could read themYou gotta tell a girl that she's beautiful till she sees itBelieves it, understands it more than physicallyMentally, and the way that I'm feelin'I could talk for ten years about the moments that we sharedThe jokes that we had runnin', the places that we beenThe music we made together, producin' next to my bedThen makin' my minor changes in reference to what she saidI think I started gettin' tired, my schedule's a messReplies are gettin' lazy and my lady knows it's crazyBut she's there if I'm in need while I'm at shows gettin' temptedBy girls that are on their knees, you know I'm only a teenIt's like my eyes started driftin', not as easy as I picturedTo give your all to a woman, ignorin' all this attentionThat's been gettin' to my head, the sex is so accessibleOne message or text and girls will get in your bedShe's tryna make it happen with photos at her eventsI mention it's her passion, photography is her thingAnd I don't know if it's the pressure where paper meets the passionAnd the pleasure, we all gotta work to surviveSo now she's popping up at shows, takin' pictures on her ownAnd at first, it wasn't cool but, fuck it, we'll let it goUntil I saw her in some rapper's tracksuit, I felt a wayShe told me it was work and she was in some studioTakin' pictures and I just sighed, some halfway-wannabeRappers had fed her lies, they ain't lookin' for no pictureI know it's your profession but read their intentionsThey ain't payin' male photographers to shoot that same sessionAnd I felt so disrespectful, standin' on her dreamsAnd crushin' 'em, I just told her it's nothing, do what you need to doIf I ain't feedin' you then my opinion'sAll I'm givin' when I speak to you 'cause I don't have the rightWhy should girls be punished for a male's dirty mind?When I think about it now, I'm ashamed to the coreI mean how many men stop their women from achievin'What they can because in secret they been feelin' insecure?And I can't handle my emotions, it's probably why I didn't see herTalent when I should've been supportin' and promotin'Like I didn't have a platform, a voice and a followin'With everyone I knew, I really coulda done a lot of thingsTo help chase her dream but instead of me to growInto the person that she needs, I acted like I couldn't seeAnd I don't mean to say this like I don't trust the girlBut how can I trust her if I don't trust myself?And even girls can get tempted, you know how it goesWhat if she meets a bigger rapper when she's at a show?What if he sees her backstage? What if he's sellin' lots?What if he's got a bigger car? Got a better watch?That doesn't bother me, she really ain't materialIt's all the little things they do that put the fear in youWhat if he actually replies? What if he phones her too?What if he's doin' all the things that I'm supposed to do?What if he's listenin', laughin', relatin'?What if he even cares to ask her how her day's been?What if he's tryna give her everything she needsAnd expects from the one damn person that she's datin'?I shoulda helped her follow her dreamBut instead, I held her back and had her followin' meAnd boy's got a brave face so they'll never knowThat it hurts just as much when you let them go

Save your sympathyMy childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemeteryHere's a message to the newborns waitin' to breatheIf you believe, then you can achieve: just look at me!Against all odds, though life is hard we carry onLivin' in the projects, broke with no lights onTo all the seeds that follow me, protect your essenceBorn with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now!

 [Hook: Johnny P]Smile for me, won't you smile?Just smile, smile for meSmile for meWon't you smile? Just smile[Verse 3: 2Pac]Fuck the world, as we unloading, witness furious speedsUnanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G'sBackstabbed and bleedin'Crooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin'Duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'Inhale the sherm smoke, visualize the flamesWill I be smothered by my own pain?Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss usTakin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get usHit us all, give us plenty centuriesForgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiariesThe best revenge is ""Fuck friends!"" – we military minded soldiersBustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find JehovahTo help me, somebody save me, lost and crazyScared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babiesMaybe now niggas feel me now, picture my painEmbrace my words, make the world changeAnd still I smile, nigga

 [Bridge: Scarface]And now a moment of silence, let us prayAnd as you journey into outerspaceMay the angels help to lead the wayMay the prayers that our families madeShine up on your soul to keep you safeAnd all the homies that done passed awayThey there to greet you as you pass the gatesAnd as you headed to the tunnel's lightI hope it leads to eternal lifeWe say the prayers for the homie 'Pac[Hook: Johnny P]Smile, smile for meAll you need to do is smileWoooo smile for meCome on, smile for me
